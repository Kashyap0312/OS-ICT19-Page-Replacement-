# ✵ OS - Page Replacement

A brief description of what this project does:

We made Page Replacement Algorithms where students can able to learn Page Replacement Algorithms from scratch and also implement Algorithms on this website. Here we also provided animated video for clearing basic ideas. And for deep understanding also various blogs and tutorials are available.

This algorithm helps to decide which pages must be swapped out from the main memory in order to create a room for the incoming page. This Algorithm wants the lowest page-fault rate.

Various Page Replacement algorithms used in the Operating system are as follows;
